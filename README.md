# ðŸ“¡ Signals for React (SFR)

Signals for React (SFR) is a library that aims to provide signal primitives for React applications without relying on React internals. SFR signals combine the functionalities of both refs and state. 

Signals scope is to limit unnecessary re-rendering as much as possible, while keeping updated values accessible all over your React app.

They store a value that can be accessed and modified by accessing the `value` property of the signal. Additionally, signal can trigger a re-render if the component is subscribed to updates through the `sub` method of the signal.

Each signal can be bound to the component (and children) by creating satellites of said signal; finally, signals come with several utilities, such useSignalEffect or useDerived (respectively the signal version of useEffect and useMemo).

## Installation

You can install Signals for React (SFR) using npm:
```sh
# Using npm
npm install signals-for-react
```
or using Yarn:
```sh
# Using Yarn
yarn add signals-for-react
```

## Signals, the basics
A signal is a React primitive that stores a value, and can be subscribed.
It consists in an object with a `.value` property and `sub()` method.

The main concept to retain when it comes to SFR signals, is that they have to be bound to a component.

The `.value` property is a getter and setter at the same time. It allows to retireve an up to date value, and to re-assign it. Accessing the getter doesn't subscribe the component to the signal, so won't trigger any re-render.

In order to subscribe to it, you need to call the .`sub()` method. This will result in the component bound to said signal to re-render


### useSignal

`useSignal` is the main hook of SFR; it combines the `useState` and `useRef` to provide a reactive piece of state. Similar to `useRef`, it returns an object that stores the value, rather than a getter and a setter.

```tsx
const Doubler: React.FC = () => {
  const count = useSignal(0)
 ...
}
```

To access the value of the signal, you can use the `.value` property. This is similar to using `.current` with React's refs and does not trigger any UI updates. It is recommended to use the `.value` property in callbacks and event handlers, as it always reflects the most up-to-date value and avoids unnecessary re-renders.

```tsx
function handleSubmit() {
  onSubmit({
    name: name.value,
    age: age.value
  })
}
```

In order to make the signal reactive, the component needs to call the `.sub()` method. This method subscribes the component to any updates to the signal and also returns the current value of the signal.

```tsx
<p>{`The count is ${count.sub()}`}</p>
```

To update the value of a signal, you can simply reassign the value using the `.value` property. This will update the value of the signal and trigger UI updates if the `.sub()` method is called on the same signal somewhere in the component or down the tree. It will also trigger updates for any other signals that depend on it, including satellites and derived readonly signals.
```tsx
<button onClick={() => count.value *= 2}>Double</button>
```
Subscribing to a signal will cause the component using `useSignal` to re-render, even if the update or subscription is done down the tree. However, you can bind the signal subscription to the children using satellites, to prevent unnecessary re-renders, as we will see in the next chapters.

## Satellites
When it comes to updating the UI, each signal is bound to the component that created it using `useSignal`. If a child component, to whom the signal is passed down as a prop, calls `.sub()`, it triggers a re-render cascade from the parent to the child (and the whole component tree).

However, this approach undermines SFR's goal of minimizing re-renders. It essentially leads to the same number of re-renders that would occur if we were using `useState` to lift the state up, without any significant added value.

Enter **satellites**. A **satellite** is a signal that has a two-way subscription to another signal: when the parent signal updates, the satellite updates as well, and when the satellites updates, so does the parent signal. Moreover, a satellite can be bound to a different component than its parent. This allows children components to subscribe to signals passed as props without triggering the re-renders of an unsubscribed parent and the related component tree.

Howeven, conceptully, we don't have to see the relation between a signal and the satellites as a hierarchical pyramidal structure, but rather like a chainmail. Each satellite, including the original signal, is synchronously influenced by the changes in any other satellite in the chain. Therefore, we must consider this entire chain as an only signal when updating its value. The distinction between satellite layers is meaningful primarily for UI updates and component re-renders.

Finally, as we will see shortly, multiple satellites together form an **orbit**.


### useSatellite
The easiest way to create a satelite is by using the `useSatellite` hook. This hook simply takes a signal (original or satellite) as only parameter, and returns a satellite signal. 
```tsx
const Display: React.FC<{ countSignal: Signal<number>}> = ({ countSatellite }) =>  {
  const count = useSatellite(countSignal)

  return <p>{`The count is ${count.sub()}`}</p>
}

function Counter() {
  const count = useSignal(0)

  return (<main>
    <Display countSignal={count} />
    <Increase onIncrease={() => count.value += 1} /> // calling this will cause only <Display> to re-render
    <Decrease onDecrease={() => count.value -= 1} /> // same here
  </main>)
}
```
We can pass either an original signal or a satellite to `useSatellite`. 
When using `useSatellite` on the same signal in multiple layers of the component tree, we can pass either the original signal or the satellite down as prop. As mentioned before, the updates travel synchronously through the chain.
```tsx
const Parent: React.FC<{ countSignal: Signal<number>}> = ({ countSatellite }) =>  {
  const count = useSatellite(countSignal)

  // more code here
  return(<>
    <Child countSignal={count}> // this work
    <Child countSignal={countSignal}> // this is the same
  </>)
}
```
#### Caveat 1 : nullable signals
When we need to work with nullable values, we should make sure that the the prop passing the signal is not `null` or `undefined`; in fact, `useSatellite` bounds the signal the first time the hook is called; it doesn't keep track of it remaining or not in the props; threfore, when we need to deal with nullable values, the `signal.value` should be nullabble, not the signal itself.
```tsx
  // this is not good
  interface Props {
    signal?: Signal<string>
  }

  // this is what we want to use
  interface Props {
    signal: <null | string>
  }
```

#### Caveat 2 : React.memo and useSatellite
When we pass a signal to a component that is memoized with React.memo, and we want that component to re-render when its parent component re-renders, we need to bind the signal with the useSatellite hook.

The signal itself is a stable reference, which doesn't change between rerenders. Even if the memoized component calls signal.sub() to subscribe to updates from the signal, it won't trigger a re-render. However, if you pass directly the value of the signal, by calling signal.sub() in the prop, you'll be passing a different value each time the signal updatesn and this will cause the memoized component to rerender.
This exemple explains it better:
```tsx
const count = useSignal(0)

<MemoizedComponent count={count}> // it won't rerender when signal updates, unless it uses useSatellite
<MemoizedComponenet count={count.sub()}> // it will rerender even if memoized
```
### useOrbit
An `orbit` is an object which includes one or more signals, bound to the current component; `useOrbit` is a hook that takes an object (mainly the component's props) and return them, with any signal in it replaced with a satellite bound to the current component. 

This hook is usefull when we have a lot of signals passed down, and we want to bound them all to the component wihout overcrowding it with `useSatellite`s and having to deal with naming conventions.

```tsx 
interface ChildProps {
  count: Signal<number>,
  name: Signal<string>,
  notASignal: string,
}
function Child(props: ChildProps) {
  const {
    count, 
    name,
    notASignal
  } = useOrbit(props)

  return <>
    <p>{count.value}</p>
    <p>{name.value}</p>
    <p>{notASignal}</p>

  <>
} 
```
#### Caveat 1 : nullable signals
Like with `useSatellite`, when we need to work with nullable values, we should make sure that the the prop passing the signal is not `null` or `undefined`; in fact, `useOrbit` bounds the signal the first time the hook is called; it doesn't keep track of it remaining or not in the props; threfore, when we need to deal with nullable values, the `signal.value` should be nullable, not the signal itself. However, the other non-signal values are not tracked, therefore can be nullable;
```tsx
  // this is not good
  interface Props {
    count?: Signal<number>
    name?: Signal<string>
    nonSignalProp?: string
  }

  // this is what we want to use
  interface Props {
    count: Signal<null | number>
    name: Signal<null | string>
    nonSignalProp?: string // this can be nullable, as it is not a signal
  }
```

# DTS React User Guide

Congrats! You just saved yourself hours of work by bootstrapping this project with DTS. Letâ€™s get you oriented with whatâ€™s here and how to use it.

> This DTS setup is meant for developing React component libraries (not apps!) that can be published to NPM. If youâ€™re looking to build a React-based app, you should use `create-react-app`, `razzle`, `nextjs`, `gatsby`, or `react-static`.

> If youâ€™re new to TypeScript and React, checkout [this handy cheatsheet](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-typescript-cheatsheet/)

## Commands

DTS scaffolds your new library inside `/src`, and also sets up a [Vite-based](https://vitejs.dev) playground for it inside `/example`.

The recommended workflow is to run DTS in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run the example inside another:

```bash
cd example
npm i # or yarn to install dependencies
npm start # or yarn start
```

The default example imports and live reloads whatever is in `/dist`, so if you are seeing an out of date component, make sure DTS is running in watch mode like we recommend above.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

## Configuration

Code quality is set up for you with `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged`. Adjust the respective fields in `package.json` accordingly.

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Bundle analysis

Calculates the real cost of your library using [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) with `npm run size` and visulize it with `npm run analyze`.

#### Setup Files

This is the folder structure we set up for you:

```txt
/example
  index.html
  index.tsx       # test your component here in a demo app
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
/src
  index.tsx       # EDIT THIS
/test
  index.test.tsx  # EDIT THIS
.gitignore
package.json
README.md         # EDIT THIS
tsconfig.json
```

#### React Testing Library

We do not set up `react-testing-library` for you yet, we welcome contributions and documentation on this.

### Rollup

DTS uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as a bundler and generates multiple rollup configs for various module formats and build settings. See [Optimizations](#optimizations) for details.

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.json` is set up to interpret `dom` and `esnext` types, as well as `react` for `jsx`. Adjust according to your needs.

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions

Two actions are added by default:

- `main` which installs deps w/ cache, lints, tests, and builds on all pushes against a Node and OS matrix
- `size` which comments cost comparison of your library on every pull request using [`size-limit`](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)

## Optimizations

Please see the main `dts` [optimizations docs](https://github.com/weiran-zsd/dts-cli#optimizations). In particular, know that you can take advantage of development-only optimizations:

```js
// ./types/index.d.ts
declare var __DEV__: boolean;

// inside your code...
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('foo');
}
```

You can also choose to install and use [invariant](https://github.com/weiran-zsd/dts-cli#invariant) and [warning](https://github.com/weiran-zsd/dts-cli#warning) functions.

## Module Formats

CJS, ESModules, and UMD module formats are supported.

The appropriate paths are configured in `package.json` and `dist/index.js` accordingly. Please report if any issues are found.

## Deploying the Example Playground

The Playground is just a simple [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) app, you can deploy it anywhere you would normally deploy that. Here are some guidelines for **manually** deploying with the Netlify CLI (`npm i -g netlify-cli`):

```bash
cd example # if not already in the example folder
npm run build # builds to dist
netlify deploy # deploy the dist folder
```

Alternatively, if you already have a git repo connected, you can set up continuous deployment with Netlify:

```bash
netlify init
# build command: yarn build && cd example && yarn && yarn build
# directory to deploy: example/dist
# pick yes for netlify.toml
```

## Named Exports

Per Palmer Group guidelines, [always use named exports.](https://github.com/palmerhq/typescript#exports) Code split inside your React app instead of your React library.

## Including Styles

There are many ways to ship styles, including with CSS-in-JS. DTS has no opinion on this, configure how you like.

For vanilla CSS, you can include it at the root directory and add it to the `files` section in your `package.json`, so that it can be imported separately by your users and run through their bundler's loader.

## Publishing to NPM

We recommend using [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).

## Usage with Lerna

When creating a new package with DTS within a project set up with Lerna, you might encounter a `Cannot resolve dependency` error when trying to run the `example` project. To fix that you will need to make changes to the `package.json` file _inside the `example` directory_.

The problem is that due to the nature of how dependencies are installed in Lerna projects, the aliases in the example project's `package.json` might not point to the right place, as those dependencies might have been installed in the root of your Lerna project.

Change the `alias` to point to where those packages are actually installed. This depends on the directory structure of your Lerna project, so the actual path might be different from the diff below.

```diff
   "alias": {
-    "react": "../node_modules/react",
-    "react-dom": "../node_modules/react-dom"
+    "react": "../../../node_modules/react",
+    "react-dom": "../../../node_modules/react-dom"
   },
```

An alternative to fixing this problem would be to remove aliases altogether and define the dependencies referenced as aliases as dev dependencies instead. [However, that might cause other problems.](https://github.com/formium/tsdx/issues/64)
